activity = input()

    print("Performing calculations...")
else:
    print("Performing activity...")
print("Activity completed!")
#Comment from reviwing answers 08-10-19: Although my code is fine, I am very light on comments. I have copied the answer below and hashed out to illustrate this:
## Ask user for the type of activity
#print("Please enter the activity to be performed.")
#activity = input() 
#
## Determine if the activity is calculate
#if (activity == "calculate"):
#    print("\nPerforming calculations...")
#else:
#    print("\nPerforming activity...")
#
## Display message
#print("\nActivity completed.")

#[Comments 08-10-19 continued: I note the line space between elements - much clearer than mine using this.]
